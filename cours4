Networking security in Linux

-> control what get in and get out of your system

Firewall
  isolation between network interfaces
  restricted routing and forwarding
  protect services from external network
  external : Internet or other internal network
  higly configurable and has to be secured

Network domains
  internal : with servers, workstation ..
  external : internet
  DMZ : area which receive some traffic from the outside world
  and have some access to the internal network
  ex : network with only few specifics applications

Network interfaces
  used by fw
  real: wired, wifi, Bluetooth
  virtual: bridge, vpn,
  -> fw intercepts and treat data

Iptables
  applied on interface
  set of rules on any IP @, protocol, port ...
  possibility to tag application
  input : the fw is the destination
  output : the fw is the emitter
  forward : the fw is in the midle of the transmission
  throttling : avoid a service to overtake a bandwidth limit
  port redirection
    NAT

  Iptable IN
    for ex
      defin an acceptable connection (new)
      allow existing connection
      drop all (allow only white list)

  Iptable OUT
      usually, very strict on incoming traffic
      and flexible on outgoing traffic
      define src/dest allowed
      allow existing connection

  Iptable Throttling
    allow restrict any service but limit it to fair usage
    protection against DoS
    safe minimal bandwidth for emergency ssh connection
    ex : create limit on icmp to 1 req/s

 -> configuring firewall is complex
 iptables are really complexe
 nftables is easier but still not obvious
 use tools instead of : firewalld, easy firewall (user web int), shorewall

Troubleshooting a firewall
  traffic generation
    telnet & ping can change port
    nmap
  traffic monitoring
    wireshark
    tcpdump
    iptop
    -> when you listen on your firewall with a tools, you analyze traffic BEFORE the fw apply its rules

Dedicated firewall distro
  OpenWRT
    run on pc and dedicated harware (cheaper and easy to maintain)
    integrated software update
    configuration is independant from the distro
    all configuration as meta data
    good tool to implement Access Point for wifi

  IpFire
    dedicated fw to linux distro
    easy configurable

  Specialised hw
    Cisco ...

Summary
  iptable / nf table
    base for packet manipulation
    dangerous and hard to configure by hand
    unrecommandable on production

  Firewall tool
    safer than iptables
    dscribe firewall as meta data
    create correct iptable

  Isolation
    obvious at Internet entry point
    valuable on any connected device
    including virtual machine and container
    white listing startegy shall prevail
