Cgroup Seccomp

capability to monitor what is going on
->goal is to limit access to ressources to slow down an attaquant

DAC
  way to limit access based on users own
  possibility for an user to set a security policy on a object (ex:file)


Extended ACL
  To ban some utilities or tools

-> but ACL & DAC useless for network drive, or limit sharing information

Disk quota
  allow to limit disk use space
  restrict the space used by an user on a given disk
  works by mount points
  -> put limitations on physical or logical partitions
  used uid guid
  usable on any file system (network file system)

  Use 2 tools : usrquota or grpquota
  quota stored in etc/fstab
  hard/soft limit
  hard : limite writing data to disk by users without exceptions
  soft : send an alert when an user exceed disk space. No physical restrictions, grace time can be configured
  -> advice to not put it to long otherwise users considered it as taken
  by default, quotas on 90% of the use of non root user

  Monitoring/reporting
  tool repquota
  permanent monitoring : quotacheck, warnquota
  crontab : registe tasks that has to be executed
  -> enforce file using partition
  -> capability to report it automaticly if user are close to their quotas
  if u established quotas as general rules (for log files, created files, received files)
  -> garanty that in case of an attack, the attack application will not have the capability to fill the entire partition
  -> basic but efficient
  -> limit

Cgroup
  end of use, efficient
  you will limited if you try to do more than what you have been allowed
  for numbers of the limit, you will have the capatibility to use entirely the ress until someon else is trying to access it
  garanty that a malware executed tasks will have restrictions
  -> we will have possibility to go back the system, repair and kill the malware
  -> avoid post mortem analysis

  different mecanisms:
    resources limitation (RAM, buffer...)
    priorisation : a group can have a priority access to resources
    accounting : consumed ressources are noticed
    isolation : separation with namespace
    group management : functions to stop, to clone, to restore, to back up context

  cgroup facility
  concept of tree
  tree is created by the user who wants to established control
  children branch will have same restriction as its father



  may have different options about your system resources
  some subsystem (=single res, as CPU time or memory) are very usefull: cpuact (generate reports cpu resources used by task), cpuset (allow what cpu are going to use), 
  devices (subsystem with possibility to allow ou deny access to devices by tasks), freezer (suspend or resume task in a cgroup)
  net_cls (tag packet with an identifier from a particular cgroup.) Traffic controler can assign != priorities to != cgroups

  -> block devices is one of the most important part of the cgroups

Seccomp
  based on netfilter
  can filter linux system commmands
  -> on the paper is very powerfull
  But limits :
    can impact performance
    child inherit restrictions (tricky)
    valid only for well behaving applications


Summary :
  Quotas
    Basic but available on most system
    outdated by cgroups which should be prefered
  Cgroups
    powerfull and simple to use
    under-use tool
    deserve to spend few minutes on it
    systemd has the capability to activate it
  Seccomp
    powerfull but limited use case
    requires to patch each application source code
